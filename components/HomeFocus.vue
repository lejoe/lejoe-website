          I use the latest AI coding advances to build reliable, high-value software.

          I research and experiment with the newest agent techniques. I test them in real projects to see what actually works. I optimize context, fine-tune prompts, and design workflows that cut waste. The result: software delivered faster, with higher quality and real value.

          I teach the fundamentals of AI for coding and help teams go deep. We uncover the real value beyond the hype and learn how to apply it where it matters. I show why AI is not a threat but a powerful opportunity. With constant research and hands-on experience, I fast-forward the learning curve and turn uncertainty into confidence.
