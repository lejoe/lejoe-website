          I'm passionate about optimizing the transition from concept to
          implementation. I help developers and designers to find better ways to
          collaborate. We develop strategies to get more efficiently to a
          product with more value for the users.

          front-end development and its connections to other fields like
          research, design, backend, DevOps and marketing.
